Entrepreneurship in the global economy : engine for economic growth,"Entrepreneurship in the global economy : engine for economic growthEntrepreneurship. Economic development. Industrial policy. Economic policy. Globalization Economic aspects. BUSINESS & ECONOMICS  Entrepreneurship.Entrepreneurs have long been drivers of innovation in developed countries. They start companies and create new industries that keep economies strong and prosperous. Today, however, in developing nations such as China, state-controlled economies are building robust industries at stunning speed and siphoning off jobs from the West. How can entrepreneurs function in the face of this challengeCan they continue to create economic value in a globalized business environment This book addresses the crucial issue of state planning vs. free enterprise and examines specific problems surrounding entrepreneurship in the global economy through nine case histories of entrepreneurial companies. It also looks at how and why government gets involved in economic growth and how entrepreneurs contribute to economic value. Based on this analysis, the authors argue that companies can succeed, even in controlled economies, by understanding the customs and policies of countries where they do business",1139526111,978-1139526111,Cambridge University Press

The value of everything : making and taking in the global economy,"The value of everything : making and taking in the global economyValue. Capitalism.Who really creates wealth in our world And how do we decide the value of what they do At the heart of today's financial and economic crisis is a problem hiding in plain sight. In modern capitalism, value extraction is rewarded more highly than value creation: the productive process that drives a healthy economy and society. From companies driven solely to maximize shareholder value to astronomically high prices of medicines justified through big pharma's 'value pricing', we misidentify taking with making, and have lost sight of what value really means. Once a central plank of economic thought, this concept of value what it is, why it matters to us is simply no longer discussed. Yet, argues Mariana Mazzucato in this penetrating and passionate new book, if we are to reform capitalism radically to transform an increasingly sick system rather than continue feeding it we urgently need to rethink where wealth comes from. Which activities create it, which extract it, which destroy it Answers to these questions are key if we want to replace the current parasitic system with a type of capitalism that is more sustainable, more symbiotic that works for us all. The Value of Everything will reignite a long needed debate about the kind of world we really want to live in Publisher's description.",1541758242,978-1541758247,New York : Public Affairs
