Quantitative models for value-based supply chain management,"Economics, Mathematical. Économie politique. Recherche opérationnelle. Analyse de la valeur. Gestion de la chaîne logistique. Méthode quantitative. Modèle mathématique.Supply chain management SCM strives for creating competitive advantage and value for customers by integrating business processes from end users through original suppliers. However, the question of how SCM influences the value of a firm is not fully answered. Various conceptual frameworks that explain the coherence of SCM and company value, comprehended as value-based SCM, are well accepted in scientific research, but quantitative approaches to value-based SCM are found rather seldom. The book contributes to this research gap by proposing quantitative models that allow for assessing influences of SCM on the value of a firm. Opposed to existing models that limit the observation to chosen facets of SCM or selected value drivers, this holistic approach is adequate to  reflect configurational and operational aspects of SCM,  cover all phases of the product life cycle,  financially compare value impacts of profitability-related and asset-related value drivers, and  assess influences of dynamics and uncertainties on company value",3642313043,978-3642313042,Heidelberg : Springer

Openbare gezondheidszorg. Besluitvorming.Health care systems are complex and, as a result, it is often unclear what the effects of changes in policy or service provision might be. At the same time, resources for health care tend to be in short supply, which means that public health practitioners have to make difficult decisions. This book describes the quantitative and qualitative methods that can help decision-makers to structure and clarify difficult problems and to explore the implications of pursuing different options. The accompanying CD ROM provides the opportunity to try out some of the proposed solutions. The book examines: models and decision-making in health care; methods for clarifying complex decisions; models for service planning and resource allocation; and, modelling for evaluating changes in systems.",335227732,978-0335227730,Maidenhead : Open University

Business Analytics for Decision Making,"Decision making -- Statistical methods. Decision making -- Data processing. Management -- Statistical methods. Prise de décision -- Méthodes statistiques. Prise de décision -- Informatique. Gestion -- Méthodes statistiques.Business Analytics for Decision Making, the first complete text suitable for use in introductory Business Analytics courses, establishes a national syllabus for an emerging first course at an MBA or upper undergraduate level. This timely text is mainly about model analytics, particularly analytics for constrained optimization. It uses implementations that allow students to explore models and data for the sake of discovery, understanding, and decision making.Business analytics is about using data and models to solve various kinds of decision problems. There are three aspects for those who want to make the most of their analytics: encoding, solution design, and post-solution analysis. This textbook addresses all three. Emphasizing the use of constrained optimization models for decision making, the book concentrates on post-solution analysis of models. The text focuses on computationally challenging problems that commonly arise in business environments. Unique among business analytics texts, it emphasizes using heuristics for solving difficult optimization problems important in business practice by making best use of methods from Computer Science and Operations Research. Furthermore, case studies and examples illustrate the real-world applications of these methods. The authors supply examples in Excel GAMS, MATLAB and OPL. The metaheuristics code is also made available at the book's website in a documented library of Python modules, along with data and material for homework exercises. From the beginning, the authors emphasize analytics and de-emphasize representation and encoding so students will have plenty to sink their teeth into regardless of their computer programming experience.",1315362597,978-1315362595,Boca Raton

Business Analytics for Managers,"Statistics.The practice of business is changing. More and more companies are amassing larger and larger amounts of data, and storing them in bigger and bigger data bases. Consequently, successful applications of data-driven decision making are plentiful and increasing on a daily basis. This book will motivate the need for data and data-driven solutions, using real data from real business scenarios. It will allow managers to better interact with personnel specializing in analytics by exposing managers and decision makers to the key ideas and concepts of data-driven decision making. Business Analytics for Managers conveys ideas and concepts from both statistics and data mining with the goal of extracting knowledge from real business data and actionable insight for managers. Throughout, emphasis placed on conveying data-driven thinking. While the ideas discussed in this book can be implemented using many different software solutions from many different vendors, it also provides a quick-start to one of the most powerful software solutions available. The main goals of this book are as follows: · To excite managers and decision makers about the potential that resides in data and the value that data analytics can add to business processes. · To provide managers with a basic understanding of the main concepts of data analytics and a common language to convey data-driven decision problems so they can better communicate with personnel specializing in data mining or statistics.",1461404061,978-1461404064,"New York, NY : Springer New York"
