The capacity for technology businesses to grow and change with the times is linked to how these businesses develop and market technological innovations. Despite the importance of technological changes for corporate vitality, there are documented instances of corporations failing to capitalize on technological opportunities. Innovation outcome is contingent upon a match between a firm's internal capabilities and its external context. Technological Innovation addresses specific ways in which the slim odds of corporate success can be enhanced. It analyzes why companies choose certain new technologies, from a technological, economic, and institutional perspective. Based on multidisciplinary research on technological choice, the book bridges research and practice to provide an enlightening and practical study",521084725,978-0521084727,Cambridge : Cambridge University Press

Managing technological innovation : tools and methods,"Organizational change.Technological innovations. BUSINESS & ECONOMICS Industrial Management. BUSINESS  ECONOMICS Management. BUSINESS  ECONOMICS  Management Science. BUSINESS & ECONOMICS Organizational Behavior.The management of technological innovation is both an art, as well as a science; the process involves the know-how and technological core skills to deliver the functionality on the one hand, and (with an ear on the ground) the ability to identify changes in technologies to come up with new innovations on the other. This requires, as a result, frameworks, system tools, and methodologies to improve the yield in innovations. Managing Technological Innovation provides a set of tools and case studies for R & D managers to effectively manage technological innovations -- from the identifying of technological needs to the launch of the product. The book is divided into five parts. Part 1 addresses the policies and strategies necessary to provide direction to R & D organizations in the management of technological innovation. Part 2 focuses on technological assessment; presenting the methods available to better matching of technologies to strategic directions, supported with case studies to illustrate the evaluation methods. Part 3 covers the development and building of technological portfolios with new products, as well as mitigation strategies. Part 4 focus on the execution phase of built portfolios -- the development of new products. And finally, Part 5 rounds up with a study on the factors which impact the diffusion of technological innovations into the market place. This book is a practical guide for R & D professions and designers, as well as a case study reference for graduate students in pursuit of their project work.",9813207272,978-9813207271,New Jersey : World Scientific

Innovation as Process 5. Innovation as System PART II From Idea to Action 6. Inventing Innovation Policy 7. Innovation Policy Today Conclusion IndexThis timely book explores technological innovation as a concept, dissecting its emergence, development and use. Benoît Godin offers an exciting new historiography of the subject, arguing that the study of innovation originates not from scholars but from practitioners of innovation. Godin looks to engineers, managers, consultants and policy-makers as the instigators of our current understanding of technological innovation. Offering a conceptual history of the subject, Part I considers the many iterations of innovation - as an science applied, outcome, process and system - to track and analyse the changing discourses surrounding technological innovation. In Part II, the author turns to historic and contemporary innovation policy to illustrate the critical role that practitioners have had in formulating and strategizing policy. Effectively rewriting the historiography of the topic, this book is critical reading for scholars of innovation studies, sociology and the history of science and technology. Students will benefit from Godin's pioneering approach to the subject and policymakers will also find value in the book's unique insight into innovation",1839104015,978-1839103995,Edward Elgar Publishing

We need to recognise that change is at the heart of it. And that change is caused by decisions that people make. The framework in Chapter 1 (Figure 1.9) attempts to capture the iterative nature of the network processes in innovation and represents this in the form of an endless innovation circle with interconnected cycles. This circular concept helps to show how the firm gathers information over time, how it uses technical and societal knowledge, and how it develops an attractive proposition. This is achieved through developing linkages and partnerships with those having the necessary capabilities""",1292251522,978-1292251523,Hoboken Pearson
